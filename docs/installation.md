# Manually Install a ZXP File

If you downloaded the ZXP archive from either Adobe Exchange or another marketplace, you can manually install the archive using [ZXP Installer](https://zxpinstaller.com). After downloading the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows or MacOS), double-click the app icon and drop the Icon Mason ZXP file onto the window. ZXP Installer will handle the rest. Be sure to restart Illustrator after the extension is installed to enable it.

**NOTE** If you choose to manually install the extension, you will need to obtain a license key from [AEScripts.com](https://aescripts.com)
