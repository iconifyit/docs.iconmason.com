# Import IconJar, ZIP, or Folder

Icon Mason can import icons from an IconJar archive, ZIP archive, or a folder of SVG icons. Click the `Import IconJar` button (highlighted below) and follow the prompts. Once you have selected your IconJar, ZIP, or folder of SVG icons, each icon will be imported and placed on its own artboard. The artboard name will be set to the file name, minus the file extension.

Keep in mind that Illustrator, as of October, 2020 allows a maximum of 1,000 artboards. In version 1.0 of Icon Mason, if your IconJar, ZIP, or folder contains more than 1,000 icons, only the first 1,000 will be imported. In a future version of Icon Mason we will have the extension create as many new documents as are needed to import the full icon collection.

## About ZIP archives

In order for Icon Mason to import a ZIP archive of icons, the icons must be contained inside of a folder named `icons` inside of the ZIP archive.
