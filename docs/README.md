# Icon Mason for Adobe Illustrator

Icon Mason, or simply "Mason", for short, is an extension for Adobe Illustrator that allows you to open, create, edit, import, and export IconJar and ZIP format icon archives direcvtly in Illustrator.

Icon Mason is not a replacement for IconJar. Quite the contrary. Icon Mason is a companion extension to make IconJar even more useful for your workflow. Icon Mason also allows you to share your IconJar archives with Windows users. Yes, you read that right, Icon Mason works with Micrsoft Windows.

Icon Mason makes it easy to organize and interact with icons inside of Illustrator. The extension can read IconJar archives, ZIP archives, as well as the file system. You can easily drag-and-drop icons one-at-a-time from the Icon Mason palette or import all of the icons to individual artboards.

If you are an icon designer, and have your icons arranged on artboards, you can create an IconJar archive with a single mouse click. The artboard names are used as the file name. If your artboard is named with dash-seperated keywords, the artboard name will also be used to automatically add tags to the icon's meta data inside of IconJar.

The Icon Mason UI allows you to add icons to an IconJar archive either from the file system or by selecting an icon in your Illustrator canvas, and right-clicking the palette UI.

You can also modify Icon Sets and individual icons by updating their meta data, editing the icon file, replacing, or removing them completely. You can even move icons between icon sets within the same IconJar archive.
