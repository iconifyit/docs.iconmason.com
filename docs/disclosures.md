# Disclosures

Some links on this site may contain affiliate links to IconJar and Round Icons. If you purchase a license to either product via that link, we will make a small commission. This helps us continue to pay for the significant cost of building and maintaining Icon Mason (as a one-person operation)_.

You do not need to purchase or install IconJar in order to use Icon Mason. Icon Mason works independently of IconJar and is able to create and read IconJar format archives. But I hope you _will_ buy IconJar by clicking the link above.

I believe Round Icons are the best collection of SVG icons available on the market. Ramy, the designer and owner is also a close friend and we hope you will support his work - he has been incredibly supportive of my work.
