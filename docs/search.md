# Search

Icon Mason uses fuzzy search to search your icon archive. This means that you do not need to match the keywords exactly. Icon Mason will return all matches that are close to the search phrase you enter. For instance, if you search for `foot`, Icon Mason will also display icons such as `food` and `flood`.

**Advanced Tip** You can customize the fuzzy search in Icon Mason by adding a [Settings](settings.md) file (learn more by clicking the link).
