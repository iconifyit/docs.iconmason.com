# Add Selection

Add an icon from the Illustrator canvas to the current IconJar by selecting an object in Illustrator, right-click on any icon in the icon grid, and select `Add Selection` from the context menu. The icon will be added to the IconJar and default meta data filled in. You can then follow the steps to [Edit Icon Meta Data](edit-icon.md) to update the icon as desired.
